# Vulnerability Assessment Report – Task 1

## Overview
This repository contains a Vulnerability Assessment Report completed as part of the
Cyber Security Internship Program by Future Interns (2026).

misconfigurations and vulnerabilities using ethical, read-only techniques, and to
present the findings in a clear, business-friendly manner.

## Target Website
